### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible PhoenixAlerts
- Enable a sustainable system for PhoenixAlerts's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code is linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export const foo = 'bar';

  // Instead of:
  const foo = 'bar';
  export { foo };
  ```
* Place imports in the following order:
  * Built-in Node.js modules (such as `path`)
  * External modules (such as `express`)
  * Internal modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
  * Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
  * Instance methods and properties

### React/JSX Styleguide

* Use functional components and hooks instead of class components
* Use proper naming convention for components (PascalCase)
* Use destructuring for props
* Prefer named exports over default exports
* Use a linter with React plugin

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for documentation.
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{.name}` notation, e.g., `{Component#render}`.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue has a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.
